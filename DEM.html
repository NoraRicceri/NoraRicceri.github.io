							<h1>Digital Elevation Models</h1>

							<p>Is a general term for any digital representation of ground surface topography or terrain, DEMs are widely used for terrain analysis, hydrological modeling, and land-use planning.
							DTM represents the bare ground surface. DTMs are especially useful in engineering, land surveying, and flood modeling.<p>

  							<li>DTM represents the bare ground surface. DTMs are especially useful in engineering, land surveying, and flood modeling.</li>
  							<li>A DSM captures the elevation of the top surface of the Earth, including all natural and man-made objects on it, it is essential for urban planning.</li>
							</ul>

							<h3>My ROI</h3>
							<p>I selected a region in the south of the Netherlands, enclosed between the cities of Haelen and Swalmen. To the east of my Region of Interest (ROI) lies the German border.</p>
							<p>I chose this area because the teacher initially suggested looking at the south of the Netherlands if we wanted to find wild rivers. I came across this part of the river Meuse (Maas), and I thought it could result in a beautiful and interesting final map.</p>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/New_DSM.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="400" /></span>
							<p>The DSM map highlights the locations of trees and other  surface features, giving the map a different texture compared to the DTM. The border with Germany is again visible due to missing data. Choosing the color palette for the DSM was more challenging, as I needed to find a compromise between aesthetics and the ability to distinguish features such as houses and trees.</p>
						
						</div>
						<span class="image main"><img src="images/DTM.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="400" /></span>
						<p>In my DTM, the border with Germany is clearly visible, with missing data for that part of the image. The elevation varies throughout the region; near the river, the elevation is very low, gradually increasing to almost 30 meters at the yellow spot on the right. I chose not to add shadowing because I did not like the visual effect. For the color scheme, I selected 'viridis' because it effectively displays elevation differences, is visually appealing, and enhances the map's readability.</p>

						<h2>Old Map Assignment</h2>
						<p>This Assignment consists in finding an Old map of the ROI we chose for hte DEMs Maps and overlay the two layers.</p>

						</div>
						<span class="image main"><img src="images/Old_map_jpeg.jpeg" alt="" width="400" height="400" /></span>
						<p>For the old map, I selected one created in 1830 by Philippe Marie Guillaume Vandermaelen (1795–1869). The physical size of the map is 47.00 x 60.00 cm, and its scale is 1:117,000. The commissioner is not explicitly named, but the publisher is the Établissement Géographique.</p>
						</div>
						</div>
						<span class="image main"><img src="images/Past_and_present_final.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="400"  /></span>
						<p>This map represents the overlay of the old map onto the DSM, with transparency applied. I chose to overlay the old map on the DSM because the color contrast made it easier to observe changes in the river's course. It is evident that the old map was quite accurate in depicting the borders with Germany, the river, and nearby cities such as Haelen. The river has maintained almost the same shape over time, which I found particularly interesting.</p>
						</div>

						<h2>Skills</h2>
						<p>Throughout the assignment, I focused on selecting color schemes that not only made the maps visually attractive but also enhanced the readability of the data. The color choice for the DSM has given me some hard times. This assignment allowed me to combine new technical GIS skills with artistic design, deepening my appreciation for both the scientific and creative aspects of cartography. I enjoyed exploring historical and modern data, and I am proud of the final results.</p>
