							<h1>Carbon Sequestration</h1>
							<p> Carbon Sequestration Index = shows where and how much carbon dioxide (CO₂) is being captured and stored</p>

							<h2>Definitions</h2>
							<ul>
							<li> Carbon Sequestration Index = shows where and how much carbon dioxide (CO₂) is being captured and stored</li>
  							<li>Gross primary production (GPP) = the GPP is the total amount of carbon dioxide that plants absorb from the atmosphere through photosynthesis within a period of time. It is important because it represents the total carbon uptake potential of a region of interest. Mapping GPP identifies high-productivity areas ( for example dense forests, wetlands) ideal for maximizing carbon sequestration. It directly informs where restoration or conservation efforts would yield the highest carbon capture.</li>
  							<li>Aboveground carbon density (ACD) = ACD measures the amount of carbon stored in living woody biomass such as trees and shrubs. It does not include the carbon stored in roots, soil, leaf litter or dead wood. ACD provides a baseline for existing carbon stocks. Mapping ACD helps prioritize high-carbon zones for protection and calculates potential carbon credits.</li>
  							<li>Forest Cover (FC) = FC is the percentage of land covered by forests. Forest cover is a proxy for carbon storage potential. Mapping FC identifies deforestation/reforestation hotspots, enabling targeted interventions. Increases in FC correlate with higher carbon sequestration, while losses indicate emission risks. FC maps also validate offset project effectiveness.</li>
  							<li>Carbon sequestration potential index (CSPI) = CSPI is an index which identifies where the potential for carbon sequestration following afforestation would be highest within a landscape. CSPI integrates GPP, ACD, soil data, and land-use constraints to identify where interventions would maximize carbon sequestration.</li>

<h2>My ROI</h2>
		<p>As my ROI, I chose the Parc national des Cévennes, which is located in southern France. It is situated within the regions of Occitanie and Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes and it’s the largest national park in mainland France. The park is characterized by a mid-mountain landscape and serves as a transition between the mountainous interior and the Mediterranean coastal plain. France: 44.3308° N, 3.4282° E</p>
		
<h2>Conservatin and reforestation areas</h2>
		<p>I recommend designating a conservation area in the part of my region of interest (ROI) where the map shows a bright green colour. This area corresponds to the highest levels of carbon sequestration. Establishing a conservation area here would help maintain the ecosystem’s health and maximize its ongoing carbon storage potential. I would suggest that planners establish a reforestation area in the darker zones delineated by the red lines, where current carbon sequestration is lower. By targeting these areas for reforestation, it is possible to significantly increase the region’s overall carbon storage capacity.</p>
